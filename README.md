If you ever want to blow away all the plugins + `./lazy-lock.json` to reinstall the latest of everything:

```sh
rm -rf ~/.local/share/nvim
```

Then eveything should re-install once you open `nvim` the next time.

## Plugin I've tried and aren't for me

This purpose of this section is so I don't continue to see these plugins as shiny things to try when I already have

- [mini-files.nvim](https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.nvim/blob/main/readmes/mini-files.md)
  - It certainly looks nice how it can appear on top of existing buffers.
  - But because there's no way to open buffers with this, it's just a pure competitor to oil.nvim for me
  - Given this, I prefer oil for my taste because I like that it goes full screen so I'm full into my file operations
- [folke/trouble.nvim](https://github.com/folke/trouble.nvim)
  - I hoped that similar to folk's TODO plugin, that this would magically be able to show me all the diagnostics for the project. Alas, that was too much to expect and would probably not be performant
  - However, given the same diagnostics functionality as Telescope, I don't dislike seeing them in a quickfix list vs a Telescope window, but I'm not sure that makes a big enough difference to go with this over Telescope
  - The symbol browser is way better than the Telescope one and I would totally use this plugin just for this symbol view! Unfortunately, I can get it to a usable state and after reading the source code for the plugin, I don't think it's customizable enough
  - It looks like the only styling / position options for how to show anything with Trouble are listed [here](https://github.com/folke/trouble.nvim/blob/main/lua/trouble/command.lua#L57), which are quite limited. I tried every combination I can think of and it's all unusable.
  - I like this symbols viewer enough that I'm keeping the plugin file around and just disabling the plugin in hopes that one day I can achieve what want
  - TODO: Check to see if this plugin has been update with more customizability
- [kungfusheep/snipe-lsp.nvim](https://github.com/kungfusheep/snipe-lsp.nvim)
  - Seems pretty nice, but the results that show up in the menu are much fewer than appear with Trouble or Telescope
- [catgoose/telescope-helpgrep.nvim](https://github.com/catgoose/telescope-helpgrep.nvim)
  - I was excited by this one because I would prefer this over using the Snacks picker for searching help pages
  - Unfortunately, the search results here are far inferior to the Snacks picker so I'll have to go back to Snacks
- [karb94/neoscroll.nvim](https://github.com/karb94/neoscroll.nvim)
- [echasnovski/mini.animate](https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.animate)
- [folke/snacks.nvim - scroll](https://github.com/folke/snacks.nvim/blob/main/docs/scroll.md)
  - These smooth scrolling plugins always seem nice but after trying them out, they end up making things feel a bit less instant due to the animation. Oh well!
  - I tried all 3 of these plugins and they all felt exactly the same. Slow. But pretty!
- [pocco81/true-zen.nvim](https://github.com/pocco81/true-zen.nvim)
  - The video demo on the true-zen github page is awesome and is exactly what I'd like to achieve:
  - Zen mode in the middle but with the ability to open the file explorer if I'd like
  - Sadly, the plugin has not had an update in 2 years and appears to be abandoned
- [shortcuts/no-neck-pain.nvim](https://github.com/shortcuts/no-neck-pain.nvim)
  - Unlike true-zen, this plugin is actively maintained! And has some nice features that make it unique to other zen style plugins
  - Unfortunately, it's not quite customizable enough. I love that it has integrations with other plugins like nvim-tree
  - But there are not enough options I can set on that integration with nvim-tree so the tree buffer opens at it's full width instead of the smaller one that I'd like
- [folke/snacks.nvim - zen](https://github.com/folke/snacks.nvim/blob/main/docs/zen.md)
  - It's weird that this one is different enough from folke's standalone zen plugin that I actually use
  - I tried moving to this one and found that the set of options available were not enough to make it look like the old one
  - Beyond that there were no new features available in this one that made it worth switching
- [folke/twilight.nvim](https://github.com/folke/twilight.nvim)
  - I knew that I probably wouldn't like this plugin for coding, but I wanted to try it out for use with markdown. I tried it briefly and didn't really love it. It felt like the section I want visible is totally different depending on the page, paragraph, line, or word that I'm editing.
  - It also, sadly, doesn't play super well with the markdown.nvim plugin and that plugin is way way more valuable
  - Perhaps I'll revisit this plugin in the future. I like that zen-mode has an option to enable twilight when you start zen-mode. Ideally it should only turn on twilight for markdown files in zen-mode, but I didn't think it productive to spend time on that since I could already tell I didn't like it
- [leath-dub/snipe.nvim](https://github.com/leath-dub/snipe.nvim)
  - I loved the idea of using this plugin to switch between open buffers, but in pratice it was too much work. I would end up with files that had very long paths and so I'd have to visually hunt down the file first, then dart my eyes back to the start of the line to find the key I needed to hit to open the file.
  - Going back to Telescope for open buffers was better right away because I could start typing a keyword of the file I want and usually it's the only one so I just have to hit enter
  - I'd still like to try this plugin by shortening the paths, but even then I'm not it'll work out for me. For now, I've left it in the config just disabled

# Old README

If you ever run into any issues such as "nvim-tree.renderer.help not found", try this:

Enter this in command mode to show you the path to

```
= vim.fn.stdpath('data')
```

cd in there and `rm -rf` this directory `site/pack/packer/`

This would happen if you used to have the old packer setup installed. Those files could cause issues.
